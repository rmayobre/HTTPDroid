# HTTPDroid
A lightweight HTTP daemon that runs WebSocket protocol. This library is designed to be used on Android devices as a server to handle incoming commands on a LAN connection. This library will allow wireless communication for an Android device without the need of a third-party server handling sent data.

# Current Status: *Alpha (0.0.1)*
This project is not yet finished and major functions of this project are not yet properly implemented.

# What is currently being worked on?
Chrome extension is in development. Once the chrome extension is complete, I will be testing the overall stability of HTTPDroid.

# Road Map
## Alpha
At this point the project will have basic functions working, and focus on debugging for stability.
### ETA on Alpha 0.0.1?
I want to get this project rolling by the end of August 2018.
**NOTE:** I will also be developing a chrome extension to demonstrate/test this library's functionality.
### Features to be included:
* HTTP requests
* WebSocket interface
* Logging system
* Easy to use callback interface to handle WebSocket responses.
## Beta
In this stage, the library will focus on adding security features.
### ETA on Beta 0.1.0?
My current plan is to have this project in beta stage around December.
**NOTE:** I will also be developing an android app running this library as its main core. 
The app will be **FREE** and **open sourced**.
### Features to be included:
* SQLCipher *Android edition* implementation
* Authentication System
* Encryption
  * Packet encryption
  * Database encryption
## Stable release
The library will have all listed functions fully supported, as well as any features added later in development.
### Features to be released after a stable build:
* FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
* SSH (Secure Shell)
* *Possibly more...*
